                <p className="text-gray-600">
                  At PrivatecharterX, we strive to make your experience as seamless and enjoyable as possible. Our goal is to provide you with the highest level of service and security, whether you're booking a private jet, yacht, or arranging airport transfers. We believe in transparency and want to ensure you feel safe and informed every step of the way.

                <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">1. Booking Process</h2>
                <p className="text-gray-600">
                  Your journey with us begins with a simple email or phone call. Once we receive your booking request, we'll send you a confirmation. If you haven't signed the contract yet, don't worryâ€”we'll still consider your booking valid. However, the final confirmation from the airline can only be made after we receive your signed contract. If there are any delays in sending the signed contract, please understand that we can't be held responsible if the aircraft is no longer available.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="space-y-4">
                <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">2. Cancellation Policy</h2>
                <p className="text-gray-600">
                  We understand that plans can change. If you need to cancel after confirming your booking, a minimum penalty of 30% will apply, as outlined in Article 7. If you need to change the aircraft after confirmation, we'll do our best to accommodate you, but please note that cancellation charges may apply if the original airline can't provide a suitable replacement.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">3. Flight Changes</h2>
                <p className="text-gray-600">
                  We aim to stick to the schedule you've approved, but sometimes things happen. We reserve the right to modify departure and arrival times or even cancel flights for safety, weather, or technical reasons. If your flight can't go ahead as planned due to force majeure (like natural disasters or civil unrest), we won't be liable for any damages or losses. However, we'll always try to find a replacement aircraft for you.

                <p className="text-gray-600">
                  Your safety is our top priority. The carrier, who is the responsible operator of the aircraft, will ensure that the aircraft is insured in accordance with the Montreal Convention or the Warsaw Convention, depending on the specific circumstances of the flight.

                <p className="text-gray-600">
                  For security reasons, we need scanned copies of passengers' identity documents 48 hours before the flight. This helps us comply with anti-terrorism measures and ensures a smooth boarding process.

                  We offer flexible payment options, including crypto tokens. When you pay with crypto, you can expect a refund in the same form if applicable. For fiat payments, refunds will be processed as per our standard procedures. Our transaction fees are a flat 1.2% for crypto payments, ensuring a transparent and cost-effective experience.
